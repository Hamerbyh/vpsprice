In KVM VPS, the resources of a physical server (such as CPU, memory, storage and network bandwidth) are virtualised and divided into multiple independent virtual servers. Each VPS has its own instance of the operating system and can run a variety of applications and services, just like on a separate physical server.</p><h2 id="advantages-of-kvm-vps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#advantages-of-kvm-vps"><span>Advantages of KVM VPS</span></a></h2><ul><li><p>Isolation: Each VPS is isolated from each other, which means that operations on one VPS will not affect the other VPS.This isolation provides higher security and stability.</p></li><li><p>Resource Guarantee: Compared with shared hosting, KVM VPS usually provides a certain amount of resource guarantee, such as a guaranteed number of CPU cores and memory size allocated, to ensure that the user&#39;s applications have access to the resources they have.</p></li><li><p>Performance: Thanks to KVM&#39;s high-performance virtualisation technology, KVM VPS is able to provide performance close to that of a physical server, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring higher computing power.</p></li><li><p>Flexibility and Scalability: Users can easily adjust the resource allocation of the VPS according to the actual situation, such as increasing hard disc space or memory. This flexibility makes KVM VPS ideal for growing businesses.</p></li><li><p>Control: Users can usually manage their VPS through the control panel or command line tools, including installing software, configuring networks and managing system security.</p></li><li><p>Cost-effectiveness: Compared to renting an entire physical server, a KVM VPS is usually more economical because resources and maintenance costs are spread among multiple users.</p></li></ul>',6),o=[r];function n(l,c){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const d=e(s,[["render",n],["__file","kvm-vps.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/posts/kvm-vps.html","title":"2024 KVM VPS Provider Guide: Fast VPS With KVM Virtualization","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"2024 KVM VPS Provider Guide: Fast VPS With KVM Virtualization","shorttitle":"2024 KVM VPS Provider Guide","description":"KVM technology makes VPS stable and independent, let's explore the VPS providers that support KVM.","date":"2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z","category":["VPS"],"tag":["VPS","KVM"],"head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://vpsprice.net/posts/kvm-vps.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"VPSPrice"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"2024 KVM VPS Provider Guide: Fast VPS With KVM Virtualization"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"KVM technology makes VPS stable and independent, let's explore the VPS providers that support KVM."}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"article"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2024-03-26T09:25:59.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"VPS"}],["meta",{"property":"article:tag","content":"KVM"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2024-03-26T09:25:59.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"Article\\",\\"headline\\":\\"2024 KVM VPS Provider Guide: Fast VPS With KVM Virtualization\\",\\"image\\":[\\"\\"],\\"datePublished\\":\\"2024-03-25T00:00:00.000Z\\",\\"dateModified\\":\\"2024-03-26T09:25:59.000Z\\",\\"author\\":[]}"]]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"What is KVM?","slug":"what-is-kvm","link":"#what-is-kvm","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"What is KVM VPS?","slug":"what-is-kvm-vps","link":"#what-is-kvm-vps","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Advantages of KVM VPS","slug":"advantages-of-kvm-vps","link":"#advantages-of-kvm-vps","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1711333845000,"updatedTime":1711445159000,"contributors":[{"name":"baoyh","email":"waynebyh@gmail.com","commits":2}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":1.24,"words":372},"filePathRelative":"posts/kvm-vps.md","localizedDate":"March 25, 2024","excerpt":"<h2>What is KVM?</h2>\\n<p>KVM is a virtualisation technology based on the Linux kernel.
